# gitpop

Browse the most popular github repos.

The app searches through the most popular github repos ordered by most starred, excluding your starred repos. You can remove repos from the list, which persist to a sqlite database so you don't need to worry about clearing your browser cache and forgetting which ones you've already looked at.
